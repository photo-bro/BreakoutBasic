# Breakout Basic

Based on the classic game \"Breakout\", this project is inspired by an earlier version I had made with GameMaker when I was 11 years old. That version was itself inspired by long hours of playing DXBall. However this time around I want to leverage myself a bit more and implement as much of the game as I can by hand - specifically the rough architecture, physics, collisions, and so forth - with exception to the use of Pygame for event handling and graphic blitting.
